        La vida imaginaria


        
    
        Red Notice, by Bill Browder
        * sorta an autobiography; then diverging into story about seeking redemption
        * Bill grew up in a highly successful family (grandfather famous communist in US), brother highly successful academic
        * pursued MBA at Stanford, couple of years at BCG, then russian investing
        * 

        1984, George 
        * dystopian future where citizens are under constant surveillance and manipulated by a single party, controlled by Big brother
        * Newspeak, language designed to make it impossible to commit thoughtcrime
            * contains minimal amount of words (ungood, plusgood, doubleplusgood)
        * Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past
            * 

        Brave New World, Huxley
        *

        The Art of Thinking Clearly, Rolf Dobelli
        * collection of cognitive biases and common thinking flaws
            * sunk cost fallacy:
                * $30 for a bad movie, long relationship (one cheated on the other), Concorde (France, GB)
            * social proof (herd instinct):
                * common instinct; clapping, running away from (possibly non-existent) predator, laughing comedy act
            * Reciprocity: 
                * urge to 
                * ancient risk management: sharing food w/ others after hunt (bellies of buddies serve as ones' refrigerator)
            * clustering illusion:
                * seing patterns where none are; Virgin Mary Toast for $28k (2004), Jesus tortilla (1978)
                * experiment: identify pattern: 2,4,6 ; trick, pattern simply is: x+1 has to be greater than x
            * confirmation bias:

        * DRAMA, Bitch
            * Basti -> Leticia 31.12.22
                * sie sei eine Schlampe (ref from Fred, Dat, Patrick?)
                * got touchy, invading her private space, she runs off w/ Virginia 
                * sie soll Patrick keine falschen Hoffnungen machen, er haette keine Chance bei ihr
                * NYE 21/22 Leticia and Dat kiss, 
                * Leticia (titti, tici, schnitzi) says she doubts they will ever able to spend time together (which basically excludes Basti from Hoes mad)
                * 4/22 Titti wrote Basti a letter (contents unknown)
            
        
            * Humans have a love/hate relationship with drama. We know it's not good for us, but there's always a temptation to look and even participate. (Lex Fridman, 23.12.22 Twitter)
        
            * If you want to be a Warrior, prepare to get hurt; if you want to be an Explorer, prepare to get lost; if you want to be a lover, prepare to be both (reaal clingy)

        weird (but fun) experiences:
            * GDSC Picnic hackathon:
                * Was super focused on finalizing code since our final presentation is around the corner. Asian girl named Hoeun gets touchy
                and feeds me slices of apple and other things while I am coding. Later adds me on Github. Lol. 

            * NYE 22/23:
                * sexy time with Anna in NKLs booth upstairs, which can only be entered via a trapdoor. At some point 
                people wanted to get back in (we took our time lol) and tried to open the door. I successfully stopped them at the cost 
                of multiple people seing me exposed. Next day the main topic was this little stunt. One guy notably often 
                mentioned my 'beautfiul' dick..

            * 
            
            * job offer after first time in Jena 4/22
                * guy saw how I interacted/spoke with the train lady and thought I would be a good fit for his company (supporting application process for governmental support ())

            * BobbyBroccoli
            * AppliedScience

            Konrad:
            I feel the urge to tell him that it is hard to work with him. His constant reminders that the work I am doing is not worthy bother me. 
            However!: I should not take his comments personally because:
                1. He more or less does it to everyone
                2. He probably has some deep insecurities that lead to this behavior of him constantly wanting to show that he is better
                3. I do not depend on the job nor the review
                4. The comments are justified, as they point to misunderstandings on my side:
                    What would you prefer: A mentor who completely ignores you, or Konrad, who is knowledgable/smart, but somewhat an asshole?
                    
                    -> take it as an opportunity to learn (ask questions!), ignore the comments.
            

            Who told me I would be a good founder:
                * Konrad
                    * discussion about applications of AI and how BASF can leverage it
                    * said I would be a good PM or stragetic leader
                * Marc
                    * said he could imagine me as a CEO
                * Theresa (Malte)
                    * said she could imagine me as in sales
                * PG 
                    * could be a consultant
                * 
        </p>

            Atomic habits:

    <p>
    In high school I ran a YouTube channel called 
    <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjyFznt7jwgr2d5xstnZBUg">reactionchamber</a>, 
    where I published videos from my self-built home laboratory. 
    
    As most kids, I had an affection for energetics (really just explosives, but that sounds..)
    Some stuff I synthesized:
    <ul>
        <li>Bromine synthesis from pool chemicals</li>
        <li>Smelly compounds (lots of esters)</li>
        <li>Trinitrated compounds (Cellulose, </li>
        <li></li>
